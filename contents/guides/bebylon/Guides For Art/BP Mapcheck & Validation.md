# Mapcheck & Data Validation


## Mapcheck

Mapcheck will only run on levels that are visible so you have to manually toggle the sublevels before running it

They will show up in the message log under these two categories: Bebylon & MapCheck

## Validation

Separately, there's a validation on assets that you can run. They don't get run as part of mapcheck. You run it by right clicking on the asset in the content browser

It shows up in teh DataValidation category. Don't worry about the large number, by default it includes "verbose actions"

You can filter out most of that by togggling off "info":
