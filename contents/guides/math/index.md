# Random Notes

Every Legendre polynomial are orthogonal to every polynomial with degrees less than it
- $\boldsymbol{L}_{n} \perp \boldsymbol{P}_{i} \ \forall i\in [0..n-1]$
- E.g: $\boldsymbol{L}_{n} \perp $x^{3}$

Harmonic functions => $\Delta u(x) = 0$

&nbsp;

Laplacian => Avg of neighbors at a point - point value
- Maximal smoothness/mean curvature is zero
- Poisson equation = $\Delta u$ = 0
- Think of boundary condition being a wire and a soap film covering the wire.
  That's a $\Delta u(x,y) = 0$
- Another interpretation is equilibriam state. Think of temperature
- Another interpretation is that there are no bumps or local minimas in that surface
