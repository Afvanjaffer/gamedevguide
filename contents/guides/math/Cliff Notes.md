# Cliff Notes
Condensed cheat sheet/mnemonics of stuff I forget

Measure => Size
Metric => Distance
Norm => Length
Inner Product => Angle
$L_{p}$ norm => Max() component
$L_{0}$ norm => Counting norm

Gradient => derivative
Jacobian => how a differential patch area is skewed under a (linear only?) transformation
Divergence => sink vs source aka volume density of outward flux
Laplacian => average of neighborhood

Manifold
Reimannian Manifolds

Banach Spaces
Hilbert Spaces
Sobolev Space

Functionals => functions that take functions as inputs (derivative/integral operators)
