## How to find default value of function parameters:

Hi,

This cannot be known in general, but you can check the UFunction's "CPP\_Default\_" metadata to see if a given parameter has a default argument, and the value of that default.

However, only default arguments of certain types and values can be parsed and, as it's metadata, this information only exists in builds with WITH\_METADATA defined, which is basically editor-only.

Hope this helps,

Steve
