IMovieScenePlayer::FindBoundObjects()

-   Searches all bound objects (including overrides and spawned objects)

 

Cast&lt;IMovieSceneBindingOverridesInterface&gt;(Player)-&gt;LocateBoundObjects()

-   Only returns the overrided bindings

 

Cast&lt;UMovieSceneSequence&gt;(Player)::LocateBoundObjects():

-   Finds all default bindings

 

ISequencer::GetFocusedTemplateID

\- Retrieve the currently focused (sub) sequence ID in edit mode

(4.21) IMovieScenePlayer::FindCachedObjectId(UObject& InObject, FMovieSceneSequenceIDRef SequenceID)

-   Attempt to find the object binding ID for the specified object, in the specified sequence



 

Sequence IDs:

-   SequenceID are deterministically generated by recursively hashing together the names of sub sections that sequences are instanced within, child first. So to generate the sequence ID for a given sequence, we'd use the following approach:

 

1.  FMovieSceneSequenceID CurrentID = MovieSceneSequenceID::Root;

2.  UMovieSceneSubSection\* OwningSection = ...; // Get the child-most sub section

3.  while (OwningSection)

4.  {

5.  CurrentID = CurrentID.AccumulateParentID(OwningSection-&gt;GetSequenceID());

6.  OwningSection = ...; // Get the next parent sub section

7.  }

8.   



-   There is a blueprint node (Get Sequence Binding)
