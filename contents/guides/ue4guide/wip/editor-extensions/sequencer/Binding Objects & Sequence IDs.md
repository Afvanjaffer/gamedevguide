IMovieScenePlayer::FindBoundObjects()

- Searches all bound objects (including overrides and spawned objects)

Cast&lt;IMovieSceneBindingOverridesInterface>(Player)->LocateBoundObjects()

- Only returns the overrided bindings

Cast&lt;UMovieSceneSequence>(Player)::LocateBoundObjects():

- Finds all default bindings

ISequencer::GetFocusedTemplateID

\- Retrieve the currently focused (sub) sequence ID in edit mode

(4.21) IMovieScenePlayer::FindCachedObjectId(UObject& InObject, FMovieSceneSequenceIDRef SequenceID)

- Attempt to find the object binding ID for the specified object, in the specified sequence

Sequence IDs:

- SequenceID are deterministically generated by recursively hashing together the names of sub sections that sequences are instanced within, child first. So to generate the sequence ID for a given sequence, we'd use the following approach:

1. FMovieSceneSequenceID CurrentID = MovieSceneSequenceID::Root;

1. UMovieSceneSubSection\* OwningSection = ...; // Get the child-most sub section

1. while (OwningSection)

1. {

1. CurrentID = CurrentID.AccumulateParentID(OwningSection->GetSequenceID());

1. OwningSection = ...; // Get the next parent sub section

1. }
