Unreal Engine 4 Development Guide. These are my personal notes from the past 4 years that I'm transforming into our internal dev onboarding guide.

I'm aiming to process about one section a day since the conversion from onenote/evernote/confluence is lossy and needs a final human pass to clean up little niggles.

## Webdev bs Pt 1

- [ ] Site should work on mobile
  - [x] ~~Left sidebar menu should be collapsed~~
  - [x] ~~Page TOC right sidebar menu should go away~~
  - [ ] Button to open Left Sidebar TOC drawer does not appear in mobile view
- [x] ~~Remove Redux~~
- [x] ~~General simplifications~~
- [x] ~~Convert all markdown files to kebab case~~
- [x] ~~Visual: Make sidebar collapsible~~
- [x] ~~Visual: Fix CSS typography for content. Looks like CSS fighting each other. The main guide content should match the styling of the St. Annes preset in https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/~~
    - ~~Specifically, the margins around headings & paragraphs is zero on the site~~
- [x] Visual: When you click to another page in a guide, the sidebar menu's headers will reset to their default state (fully toggled open and expanded). Instead, the menu state should persist from page to page. (Ex: click on some of the menu headers to collapse them. Then navigate to another page in the guide. The headers that you collapsed should stay collapsed)
- [x] ~~Add search - https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search/~~
  - [x] ~~Use elastic lunr & corresponding gatsby plugin~~
  - [x] ~~Should support partial matches, searching titles, and content of guides md file~~
  - [x] ~~Add Ant design Search react component in header~~
    - [x] ~~First 5 results should show up in a pop up~~
    - [x] ~~Should have button to click it to open to another search results page with all the results~~
    - [x] ~~Search should groupby guides~~

## Webdev bs Pt 2
- [ ] Better inline search
    - [ ] Should show excerpt of highlighted text
    - [ ] Allow search for specific guides
- [ ] Perf: When navigating inside of a guide, should not reload the entire page; should update just the main content part.
    - [ ] This should also not reset the scroll position of the sidebar toc menu
- [ ] Add autodemarcation of notes still to be fully transitioned
- [ ] Add search bar on the left column to search headings (example: https://gatsby-docz.netlify.com/docs/)
- [ ] #Perf: Remove page reload with sidebar when clicking around
- [ ] #Perf: Use Emotion - https://jenniferwadella.com/blog/all-the-dumb-mistakes-i-made-building-my-first-gatsby-site
- [ ] #Perf: Image Optimization - https://medium.com/@kyle.robert.gill/ridiculously-easy-image-optimization-with-gatsby-js-59d48e15db6e
- [ ] #Visual: Find a decent visual theme for markdown (https://github.com/pedronauck/gatsby-starter-docz or http://iarouse.com/dist-react-ant-design/v1.1.4/#/app/layout/page)
- [ ] Add support for ordering between headers and site pages
- [ ] CSS help: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ http://grid.malven.co/ https://visme.co/blog/layout-design/
- [ ] Further prettification: Look at css styling from https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/#examples
- [ ] Integrate Ant Admin theme (http://iarouse.com/dist-react-ant-design/v1.1.4/#/app/layout/page)
