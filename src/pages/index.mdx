Unreal Engine 4 Development Guide. These are my personal notes from the past 4 years that I'm transforming into our internal dev onboarding guide.

I'm aiming to process about one section a day since the conversion from onenote/evernote/confluence is lossy and needs a final human pass to clean up little niggles.

## Webdev bs Pt 2

- [ ] Remove Ant Admin Theme and choose a UI system
  - [ ] Material UI:
    - This looks like it has an easy integration with Gatsby and easy styling support
    - If it'd be fast to update the code from ant design to this, I'd prefer this
    - https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-material-ui/
  - [ ] Ant Design UI System
    - The other option is to stick with Ant Design.
    - Here's an example integration with gatsby: https://github.com/jannikbuschke/gatsby-antd-docs
- [ ] Autoexpand sidebar when someone goes to a page directly
- [ ] Add search bar on the left column to search headings (example: https://gatsby-docz.netlify.com/docs/)
- [ ] Make submenu headings in sidebar more noticable and more vertically more compact
- [ ] #Perf: The site responsiveness in clicking around is sluggish compared to how fast it should be
    - [ ] This is the level of site responsiveness to reach: Live Site: <https://gatsby-docs-starter.netlify.com/lesson-one> & Source: <https://github.com/ericwindmill/gatsby-starter-docs>
        - Ofcourse look at the code or perf profile, but some thoughts on what it could be:
            - Might be reloading the entire page
            - Some expensive initialization might be reperformed on every page click vs being persistent
            - Some advanced gatsby configuration settings might be set wrong. For example, the gatsby starter used for our site was the basic gatsby starter while the Gatsby Docs Starter used the Gatsby Advanced Starter. In the [Readme](https://github.com/ericwindmill/gatsby-starter-docs), it references "fast loading times thanks to pre-rendered HTML & automatic chunk loading of JS files"
    - [ ] This should also not reset the scroll position of the sidebar toc menu
- [ ] Improve the search components
    - [ ] Inline seach should display a list of excerpts and highlights
    - [ ] Search results page should also display excerpts and highlights
    - [ ] Allow search for specific guides
- [ ] Add support for ordering between sidebar toc submenu headers and site pages


## Webdev bs Pt 3

- [ ] Add autodemarcation of notes still to be fully transitioned
- [ ] #Perf: Use Emotion - https://jenniferwadella.com/blog/all-the-dumb-mistakes-i-made-building-my-first-gatsby-site
- [ ] #Perf: Image Optimization - https://medium.com/@kyle.robert.gill/ridiculously-easy-image-optimization-with-gatsby-js-59d48e15db6e
- [ ] #Visual: Find a decent visual theme for markdown (https://github.com/pedronauck/gatsby-starter-docz)
- [ ] Gatsby Theme support: Examples
    - https://medium.com/@kyle.robert.gill/a-simple-guide-to-gatsbyjs-themes-a4f9765c5ac7
    - https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/running-a-gatsby-starter-as-a-theme
    - https://github.com/jannikbuschke/gatsby-antd-docs
- [ ] CSS help: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ http://grid.malven.co/ https://visme.co/blog/layout-design/
- [ ] Further prettification: Look at css styling from https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/#examples

## Webdev bs Pt 1

- [x] Site should work on mobile
  - [x] Button to open Left Sidebar TOC drawer does not appear in mobile view
  - [x] ~~Left sidebar menu should be collapsed~~
  - [x] ~~Page TOC right sidebar menu should go away~~
- [x] ~~Regression of syntax highlighting no longer working~~
- [x] ~~Remove Redux~~
- [x] ~~General simplifications~~
- [x] ~~Convert all markdown files to kebab case~~
- [x] ~~Visual: Make sidebar collapsible~~
- [x] ~~Visual: Fix CSS typography for content. Looks like CSS fighting each other. The main guide content should match the styling of the St. Annes preset in https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/~~
    - ~~Specifically, the margins around headings & paragraphs is zero on the site~~
- [x] Visual: When you click to another page in a guide, the sidebar menu's headers will reset to their default state (fully toggled open and expanded). Instead, the menu state should persist from page to page. (Ex: click on some of the menu headers to collapse them. Then navigate to another page in the guide. The headers that you collapsed should stay collapsed)
- [x] ~~Add search - https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search/~~
  - [x] ~~Use elastic lunr & corresponding gatsby plugin~~
  - [x] ~~Should support partial matches, searching titles, and content of guides md file~~
  - [x] ~~Add Ant design Search react component in header~~
    - [x] ~~First 5 results should show up in a pop up~~
    - [x] ~~Should have button to click it to open to another search results page with all the results~~
    - [x] ~~Search should groupby guides~~
